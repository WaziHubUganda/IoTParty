# IoTParty

This will be an interactive workshop in which we shall explore an introduction to the use of IoT.

The point of the workshop is not only to show a few tricks of IoT sensors but to enable the users gain practical experience with the use of these sensors and see how they can actually program and use these to create viable businesses by solving real world problems.

## Setting Up
Please endeavour to have *Arduino IDE* installed on your local machine. There are various installations for the different operating systems to be found [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software)

Clone the repo here and follow along.
